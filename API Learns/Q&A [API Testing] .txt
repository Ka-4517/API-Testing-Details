Q&A [API Testing] 

1. How do you Define an API with an Example?
An Application Programming Interface (API) is a set of methods and protocols that allow two applications to 
interact with each other.
An example of an API is Google Maps, which allows you to integrate its services into your website or mobile 
app so that users can search for places, get directions, and view maps without leaving your website or app.


2. What are the Different Types of APIs?
Public APIs:These are APIs that are publicly available. Popular examples of public APIs include Facebook, 
Twitter and Google Maps.

Private APIs:These are APIs that are private to a particular organization or business and are used internally 
to facilitate the use of certain data and functions.Admin accessing there users detail is a example of private api.

Shared APIs:These are APIs that are managed by multiple organizations and provide data and functionality to all 
of them in a shared manner.ex: Accessing todo list of an employee.

Composite APIs:APIs that aggregate and coordinate multiple underlying APIs to provide a unified interface or functionality. 
Here's an example of a composite API for a travel booking platform:/flights,/hotels,/car-rentals,/itinerary.


3. What are the Main Differences Between API and Web Service?
Every web service is an API but not every API is a web service.
Web services always require a network for operation, whereas APIs can function without a network connection.


4. What is Web API?
API means Application Programming Interface. A Web API is an application programming interface specifically 
designed for web applications. It allows web applications to interact with each other or exchange data.


6. What is the Difference Between Client and Server APIs?
Client APIs allow applications to access data, while Server APIs allow applications to provide services.


8. How do you Test for Performance Issues in an API? 
To test for performance issues in an API, you can use tools like JMeter and LoadRunner that can monitor 
response times and analyze load tests. Additionally, you can test for server-side performance by checking 
server logs or using system monitoring tools like New Relic or Datadog.


9. Which is a Read-only HTTP Method?
The GET method is read-only in HTTP protocol.


10. Which Method is Used to Create a Resource in APIs?
Usually, the POST method is used for creating resources in APIs because it sends data from the client side to 
the server side.


11. Which Protocol is Used by RESTful Web Services as a Medium of Communication Between Client and Server?
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is used by RESTful web services as a medium of communication between client 
and server. 


12. What is the Category of 4XX HTTP Codes Belonging to?
The Category of 4xx HTTP Codes belongs to Client Error Code. The reason behind these errors could be that 
the client made an invalid request or failed to send data in its request message. 401 Unauthorized and 403 
Forbidden are some examples.


13. How do You Troubleshoot Issues Related to APIs?
The first step in debugging API difficulties is to enable logging in order to monitor any failures or problems. 
It is also critical to check all input parameters before sending them through the API, since this can prevent 
many problems from arising. It is also a good idea to see if there are any known bugs with the API or its 
dependencies that can be fixed by upgrading or patching them. Finally, in order to correctly determine where 
any difficulties may be originating from, it is critical to have a clear grasp of the system architecture and 
how different components interact with one another.

14. What is API Testing?
API testing involves testing the interactions and responses of APIs to ensure they behave as expected and meet 
the specified requirements.


15. What does the Process of API Testing Involve?
The process of API testing involves verifying that the application is functioning as expected by making sure 
that there are no errors in the code. It also includes validating that the responses sent by the server comply 
with pre-defined requirements, as well as ensuring that data sent through the API is secure. It may also 
include performance testing, which involves measuring the speed and accuracy of the responses sent by the 
application.


20. How do You Ensure the Quality and Accuracy of Your API Tests?
By adding assertions to our API tests, we can assure the quality and correctness of our API tests and uncover 
possible problems that may exist. Monitoring the API tests for a specified period of time to see if any unusual 
behavior is emerging from the API. Also integration of the tests with CI/CD pipelines and the scheduled tests 
can convey a lot about the API quality. 

22. What Difficulties Have You Encountered While Testing APIs?


24. What are Some Common Challenges When Performing API Testing?
There are several common challenges when performing API testing: 

Access – APIs may not be publicly accessible and may require special credentials or access rights.

Complexity – APIs can be complex, making it difficult to develop robust test plans.

Security – APIs may be vulnerable to attacks and require special security measures. 

Also, the challenges may vary based on the project architecture and design.
