Why we use newman?
Newman is a command-line Collection Runner for Postman. It enables you to run and test a Postman Collection directly from the command line.
Automated Testing: Newman enables you to automate the testing of your APIs by running Postman collections as part of your continuous integration (CI) pipeline or test automation framework. 
This ensures that your APIs behave as expected across different environments and releases.

Integration with CI/CD: You can integrate Newman into your CI/CD workflows to automatically test APIs after each code change or deployment. 
This helps catch regressions early in the development process and ensures the stability of your applications.

Headless Execution: Newman provides a headless mode for running collections without the need for a graphical interface. 
This makes it suitable for running tests in headless environments such as servers or containers where a graphical interface is not available.

Command-Line Interface: With Newman's command-line interface, you can easily execute Postman collections from the terminal or command prompt, making it convenient for scripting and automation tasks.

Environment Management: Newman allows you to specify different environments for running your collections, making it easy to test your APIs against various configurations such as development, staging, and production.

Reporting: Newman generates detailed test reports in various formats such as JSON and HTML, which provide insights into test results, including pass/fail status, response times, and more. These reports can be used for analysis and documentation purposes.
