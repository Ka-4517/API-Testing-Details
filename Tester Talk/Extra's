Q.1.  Is it possible to stop a postman call from being executed based on conditions detected in pre-requisite scripts?
if (!environment['X']) {
    throw new Error('No "X" set')
}
This prevents the REST call from going through. But in the collection runner mode it stops the entire test suite.

or 

var value = pm.environment.get('X')

if (value == undefined || value == null || value.length == 0) {
    throw new Error('No "X" set!')
}
