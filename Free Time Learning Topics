1->Sending binary data for RESTful APIs
RESTful APIs are the most widespread API architectural style. When sending binary data through a POST request 
in a RESTful API using Postman, only a few steps are needed:

Select the HTTP Method: In Postman, select POST as your HTTP method for your request.
Enter the URL: Input the endpoint URL where you are transmitting data.
Choose Body tab: Click on the Body tab, and select binary from the dropdown menu.
Upload the file: Click on the Select File button, and your operating system will prompt you to choose a file.
Setting headers: You will need to set the Content-Type header when sending binary data, and should match the data type you are transmitting. For example, if you are sending a JPEG image, your Content-Type header should be set to image/jpeg. Postman will attempt to set this header for you, but double-check that it is set correctly. The Content-Length header will be calculated by Postman automatically before you transmit the data.
Send your request: You can click the Send button, or you use the keyboard shortcut, typically Cmd-Enter on a Mac, or Ctrl-Enter on Windows/Linux systems.
